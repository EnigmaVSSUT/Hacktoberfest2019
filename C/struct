NESTED STRUCTURE APPLICATION IN C 

Structure is a user-defined datatype in C language which allows us to combine data of different types together.
Structure helps to construct a complex data type which is more meaningful. 

C provides us the feature of nesting one structure within another structure by using which, complex data types
are created. For example, we may need to store the address of an entity employee in a structure. The attribute 
address may also have the subparts as street number, city, state, and pin code. Hence, to store the address of
the employee, we need to store the address of the employee into a separate structure and nest the structure 
address into the structure employee.
